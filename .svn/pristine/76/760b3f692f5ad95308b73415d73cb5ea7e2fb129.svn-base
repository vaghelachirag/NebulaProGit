Still, the success of the Company and the success of Independent Business Owners is ultimately dependent upon the integrity of the individual men and women who market the products. Because Nebula Independent Business Owners are independent business enterprises, Independent Business Owners have broad latitude in how they choose to operate, and to determine the times and methods of their work. Notwithstanding this independence, Nebula reserves a contractual right to protect its intellectual property, to prevent unsupportable product claims, and to preserve the integrity of its business model. These Policies India Policies &amp; Procedures- are designed to accomplish this.

Independent Business Owners agree to indemnify Nebula and Nebula&#39;s directors, officers, employees, and agents, and hold them harmless from any and all liability including judgments, civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs, or lost business incurred by Nebula as a result of the Independent Business Owner&#39;s unauthorized representations or actions.

In particular, no Independent Business Owner may make any claim that Nebula products are useful in the cure, treatment, diagnosis, mitigation or prevention of any diseases. Such statements can be perceived as medical or drug claims. Not only do such claims violate Nebula policies, but they are potentially dangerous and may violate various national and local laws.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Income Claims:</strong></u></span></span><span style="color:#555555"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> In their enthusiasm to sponsor prospective Independent Business Owners, some Independent Business Owners are occasionally tempted to make income claims or earnings representations to demonstrate the inherent power of network marketing. This is counter-productive because new Independent Business Owners may become disappointed very quickly if their results are not as extensive or as rapid as the results others have achieved. At Nebula, we firmly believe that the Nebula income potential is great enough to be highly attractive, without reporting the earnings of others. Moreover, national and local laws often regulate or even prohibit certain types of income claims and testimonials made by persons engaged in network marketing. &nbsp;While Independent Business Owners may believe it beneficial to provide copies of checks, or to disclose the earnings of themselves or others, such approaches have legal consequences that can negatively impact Nebula as well as the Independent Business Owner making the claim unless appropriate disclosures required by law are also made contemporaneously with the income claim or earnings representation. Because Nebula Independent Business Owners do not have the data necessary to comply with the legal requirements for making income claims, a Independent Business Owner, when presenting or discussing the Nebula opportunity or Global Compensation Plan to a prospective Independent Business Owner, may not make income projections, income claims, or disclose his or her Nebula income (including the showing of checks, copies of checks, bank statements, or tax records). &nbsp;Hypothetical income examples that are used to explain the operation of the Global Compensation Plan, and which are based solely on mathematical projections, may be made to prospective Independent Business Owners, so long as the Independent Business Owner who uses such hypothetical examples (1) makes clear to the prospective Independent Business Owner(s) that such earnings are hypothetical; and (2) provides each prospective Independent Business Owner with a current copy of Nebula&#39;s official income disclosure statement. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

Nebula will permit Independent Business Owners to solicit and make sales in retail or service establishments so long as the establishment is: (1) an independent locally-owned retail establishment, and not part of a national, regional, or state-wide chain; or (2) an office of a health care practitioner. Nebula will permit Independent Business Owners to solicit and make commercial sales upon prior written approval from the Company.

Final approval will be granted to the first Independent Business Owner who submits an official advertisement of the event, a copy of the contract signed by both the Independent Business Owner and the event official, and a receipt indicating that a deposit for the booth has been paid. Approval is given only for the event specified. Any requests to participate in future events must again be submitted to the Independent Business Owner Services Department. In order to preserve its valuable brand, Nebula further reserves the right to refuse authorization to participate at any function which it does not deem a suitable forum for the promotion of its products or the Nebula opportunity.

Examples of such contact and communication may include but are not limited to: newsletters, written correspondence, personal meetings, telephone contact, voicemail, electronic mail, and the accompaniment of downline Independent Business Owners to Nebula meetings, training sessions, and other functions. Upline Independent Business Owners should also seek to motivate and train new Independent Business Owners in Nebula product knowledge, effective sales techniques, the Nebula Global Compensation Plan, compliance with Company Policies and Procedures, and compliance with local law.

While Nebula welcomes constructive input, negative comments and remarks made in the field by Independent Business Owners about the Company, its products, or compensation plan serve no purpose other than to sour the enthusiasm of other Nebula Independent Business Owners. Similarly, &quot;trash talking&quot; the competition creates a negative environment that damages the industry in a way that ultimately can harm Nebula as well.

Grievances and Complaints: When a Independent Business Owner has a grievance or complaint with another Independent Business Owner regarding any practice or conduct in relationship to their respective Nebula businesses, they are encouraged to seek to resolve the issue through private discussions with the other party.

All communication with Nebula and the Independent Business Owner seeking resolution of a dispute must be in writing. It is within the DRB&#39;s discretion whether a claim is accepted for review. If the DRB agrees to review the matter, it shall schedule a review within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Independent Business Owner&#39;s written request. All evidence (e.g., documents, exhibits, etc.) that a Independent Business Owner desires to have considered by the DRB must be submitted to Nebula no later than seven business days before the date of the review. The Independent Business Owner shall bear all of the expenses related to his or her attendance and the attendance of any witnesses he or she desires to be present at the review. The decision of the DRB will be final and subject to no further Company review.

<span style="color:#555555"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">d.

Ordered items that are out-of-stock will be placed on backorder and sent when Nebula receives additional inventory. Independent Business Owners will be charged and given Personal Sales Volume on backordered items unless notified on the invoice that the product has been discontinued. Nebula will notify Independent Business Owners and Customers if items are backordered and are not expected to ship within 30 days from the date of the order. An estimated shipping date will also be provided. Backordered items may be cancelled upon a Customer&#39;s or Independent Business Owner&#39;s request. Customers and Independent Business Owners may request a refund, credit on account, or replacement merchandise for cancelled back orders. If a refund is requested, the Independent Business Owner&#39;s Personal Sales Volume will be decreased by the amount of the refund in the month in which the refund is issued.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><br />
<span style="color:#555555"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">e.
